We need to do away with Secret Questions. You know, when you sign up for an account online, and it asks you to answer a seemingly innocuous question. And therein, lies half of the problem, the innocuous nature of the question that they ask. The other half, is that you're never quite sure what someone can do with knowledge of the secret question and its answer. 
Maybe I'm jaded, but I remember the days of several youthful indiscretions on my part where a combination of Google Fu and a very small amount of social engineering resulted in full access to others' email accounts. Back in my early teens, I used to play an online game (Asheron's Call) with account management and authentication provided by Microsoft's The Zone. There was a thriving community on IGN's VNBoards forums for the game, including server specific individual forums. There was a thread where people posted where they lived in real life. On it's own, this would be no problem. However, accounts on VNBoards had an optional publically visible email field. Zone accounts were tied to an MSN or Hotmail email address. In many cases, the very same email that was publically visible on the user's VN account. Hotmail was the most popular email provider of the day, and it was the easiest to reset the password of.

The first step of gaining full access to the email account was scanning the entire thread and seeing which users had a Hotmail email address tied to their account. Then trying the password reset functionality for the email address in the cases where it was a Hotmail account. The reset was a two step process. Step One involved entering the user's zip code (and Country and State, but those are a product of one's zip). Google made it pretty easy to turn the posted string describing a user's location from the VN thread into a list of zip codes, which could then be tried one by one until it accepted one and brought you to Step Two.

The second step would ask you for the answer to the user's secret question. Who honestly remembers exactly which secret question they picked for a service they signed up for months or even years ago? These questions are designed to be innocuous. And there's the problem. A stranger can ask you these sorts of questions and without even thinking about the security implications you'll probably respond honestly. 

Succeeding with my social engineering experiment in some cases was as simple as Googling the user's zip code plus the words 'high school' to get the name of the schools in the area and trying different permutations of capitalizing or abbreviating the school's name. In other cases, due to either a slightly more personal question, or due to weak Google Fu, approaching the user was necessary.

Approaching them and getting the answer was pretty simple. Create a new character on the online game with a very feminine name, send them a private message stating that you're a girl who thinks they know them (Saw you live in my town from the 'Where do you live?' thread on VNBoards!), build some rapport and then ask them the secret question. Wait for them to log off, rest the password, and BAM! Full account access to their email. Despite the questionable morality of gaining full access to the user's email, I thankfully had enough moral fiber as a pre-teen (Thanks Mom and Dad!) to not be a dick and abuse the power. I politely left them an email from themselves explaining how I did it, and that they should probably change their secret answer to something a little harder to social engineer out of them.

Now, while these secret questions may have seemed like a good idea back in the early days of the Internet, I'd hope that we would have done away with them entirely by now. The above use-case is an explanation of the worst-case scenario for how secret questions can be exploited. However, when required to put a secret question on a new account, you're left totally in the dark as to how and when a secret question will be posed to you, or whether someone can take over your account with nothing but these bits of information. What site have you ever signed up for that tells you how and when they use the secret questions? Personally, I don't know that I've encountered any.

The biggest problem with Secret Questions as a standard, is that there is no standard.

 Ever since my little experiment, I've answered every single Secret Question question by mashing random buttons on the keyboard and submitting. This has only ever caused me problems once, and an email to the support team solved the issue. 

What I'm proposing is that we get rid of these things entirely. I'm not here with a perfect alternative. Off the top of my head, maybe sending the user a text message with a one-time passcode, or asking extremely personal questions instead of harmless ones, or asking for characters 12-16 of your favorite credit card; I'm betting that a better option exists than any of these. However, the total removal from the web of Secret Questions in their current incarnation would be a better alternative than continuing to use them as they exist today.
